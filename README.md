# blogging-reloaded
_The purpose of this project is to create a blogging website that combines the traditional format of personal micro-blogging, currently pioneered by Tumblr, with the community-oriented blogging format popularized by Tumblr, as well as the communication style of web forums. The website will essentially be organized into two arenas: a user will have their own personal blog, and can create a community blog which will have a forum space as well as a blog space that other users can submit posts to._

ESSENTAIL FUNCTIONS:
* Optimize blog posts for basic media types: **text, picture(s), video, audio**
* A user can **tag posts**, and filter posts by tags.
* Users can **follow other blogs** and communities, and new posts from these entities will show up in a feed on the user's homepage.
* Users can **reblog** a post from someone else's personal blog onto their own personal blog, with a notation that it has been reblogged (as opposed to an original post from the user).
* Users can **comment** on a post.
* When reblogging, users can choose to **highlight a comment (or comments) to display** on their blog alongside the post that is being reblogged.
* Comments are **nested** by thread.
* Every blog has an **archive view**.
* Users can **create communities**.
* Communities have a **forum section and a media feed**.
* Users can **make forum posts** and submit to community feed.
* Communities can be **moderated** by a user.
* 

OPTIONAL/IF-WE-HAVE-THE-TIME FUNCTIONS:
* Users can **customize the CSS** of their personal blog.
* Users can **customize the CSS** of their community blogs.
* Users can **ban** other users from following and contacting their blog.
* Users can **send private messages** to other users, which will be stored as a conversation thread in their inbox.
* Users can **upvote comments** so that they will be displayed at the top of the comments list.
* Users can create **lists of trusted users**, who have the special permission to view posts that they mark as friends-only.
* A user's **blog can be sorted** by original posts only, reblogged posts only, or all posts.
* Offer **different skins for the homepage feed**.
